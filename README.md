## A beginners first independant programming assignment.

- My motivation for creating this website, was to be able to have a place to have all of my current and future works all in one place, as well as contact information
- This site solves the issue of needing a consolidated website that users can go between various project links.
- I learned how to utilize flex boxes, along with fundementals of HTML and CSS to be able to make a design similar to my mockup.
